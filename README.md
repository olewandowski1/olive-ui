# Olive UI

A registry of pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI sections ("blocks") designed to integrate seamlessly with your `shadcn/ui` projects. Add complex UI structures directly using the standard `shadcn/ui` CLI via URL, without modifying your existing `components.json` registry settings.
