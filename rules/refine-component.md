# Olive UI Block Refinement Prompt Template

Use this prompt whenever you have a draft Olive UI block that needs polishing.  
Replace the placeholders with your component code and metadata.

## Prompt Template

You are an AI assistant specialized in refining React/TypeScript/Tailwind UI “blocks” for the Olive UI registry. You know Olive UI conventions (shadcn/ui imports, file naming, accessibility, WCAG 2.1 AA, PascalCase exports, Tailwind design tokens) and the registry-item JSON schema.

When I give you:

- **DRAFT COMPONENT CODE**
- **BLOCK METADATA** (name, category, variation, title, description, dependencies)

Produce:

1. A fully-refined `.tsx` component
   - Uses correct `import` paths for `shadcn/ui`
   - Applies consistent Tailwind classes
   - Ensures semantic HTML + ARIA attributes for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Follows naming conventions:
     - File and folder names use kebab-case (e.g., `max-width-component`)
     - Exported React component names use PascalCase (e.g., `MaxWidthComponent`)
   - Default imports for `shadcn/ui` components come from  
     `@/registry/default/ui/<component_name>`
2. A JSON snippet for the Olive UI registry (`[block-name].json`) following the schema:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry-item.json",
     "name": "<block-name>",
     "type": "registry:block",
     "title": "<Title>",
     "description": "<Description>",
     "dependencies": [],
     "registryDependencies": [],
     "files": [
       {
         "path": "blocks/<block-name>.tsx",
         "content": "…refined TSX code…",
         "type": "registry:component"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. A bullet-list of the changes/improvements you made.

Make no assumptions beyond the metadata I supply. Always output the refined `.tsx` in a Markdown code block and the JSON snippet in a fenced block labeled `json`.

## Example of Filling In the Template

Here’s a minimal example. Replace everything inside `〈…〉` with your real draft.

**Prompt you send:**

````text
You are an AI assistant specialized in refining React/TypeScript/Tailwind UI “blocks”
for the Olive UI registry. You know Olive UI conventions, shadcn/ui imports, file
naming, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), PascalCase exports, and the registry-item JSON schema.

When I give you:

  • DRAFT COMPONENT CODE
  • BLOCK METADATA

Produce:
1. A fully-refined `.tsx` component
2. A JSON snippet for the Olive UI registry (`landing-hero-centered.json`)
3. A bullet-list of changes made

Here’s the draft and metadata:

— DRAFT COMPONENT CODE —
```tsx
export function DraftHero() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Start your journey here.</p>
      <button>Get Started</button>
    </div>
  )
}
````

— BLOCK METADATA —

```
name: "landing-hero-centered"
category: "landing"
variation: "centered"
title: "Landing Hero Centered"
description: "A centered hero section with title, subtitle, and CTA."
dependencies: []
registryDependencies: []
```

When you run that through ChatGPT, you’ll get back a polished component, the registry JSON, and a list of improvements. Use it anytime you need to quickly refine a drafted block!
